# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This app was mainly a test of HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. The starter code and basic back-end set-up were provided to me.

## User Interface

Feast your eyes on this delightful colour scheme and layout! But if you think it's all style and no function, you don't know Tweeter yet! This app seamlessly adds tweets from our Mongo database and updates them before your eyes. You'll never have to refresh the page!

Check out how the tweets brighten up and show the Favourite, Retweet, and Flag icons when you hover the mouse over them. Snazzy!

Do you  have important thoughts to express? Tweeter can't wait to hear them! Click the "Compose" button to toggle the new Tweet section on and off (nice functionality!), and Tweet away!

Make sure to stay within  the 140-character limit, or you might get a not-so-stern error message.

Check out your custom randomized handle and avatar too. You look great!

Are you dying to sign up yet? Well you can't. Besides probably infringing on copyright laws, Tweeter doesn't currently have user login/logout functionality. But stay tuned! More features are being developed all the time.
